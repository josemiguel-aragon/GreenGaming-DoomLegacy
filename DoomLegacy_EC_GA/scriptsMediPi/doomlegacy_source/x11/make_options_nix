# DoomLegacy Make options for Linux, FreeBSD
# See README_compiling.txt
# Edit for OS, SMIF, and other compile options.
#
MAKE_OPTIONS_PRESENT=1

# Select an OS: LINUX FREEBSD NETBSD
#  Linux works for all other *nix platforms, as far as we know.
#  FreeBSD requires differences in the Makefile and code.
#  NetBSD requires COMP_ENVIRONMENT too.
OS=LINUX

# Select a draw library:
#  SDL: the SDL library is recommended and is the best maintained interface
#  LINUX_X11: LINUX X11 native drawing
#  FREEBSD_X11: FreeBSD X11 native drawing
SMIF=SDL
#  Enable to use SDL2, otherwise will use SDL 1.2
# SDL2=1
#  If sdl-config is missing, then where the SDL/SDL2 library was installed.
# SDL_DIR=/usr/local

# SDL_Mixer library is a separate library from SDL
HAVE_MIXER=1

# Enable compile environment settings be used:
# NETBSD seems to require this be enabled.
# COMP_ENVIRONMENT=1

# Put other options here, see the src/Makefile or README_compiling.
# Compiler select: GCC MINGW WATCOM CLANG
# CC_SELECT=GCC
# Enable CC_ENVIRONMENT to use the environment CC var.
# CC_ENVIRONMENT=1
# CC_EXPLICIT=clang

# Architecture custom compile will result in faster smaller code,
# but will not execute on incompatible machines.
# Any valid value for -march= on your compiler may be set here.
# For more information, ask your compiler.
# > gcc --target-help
# The default for GCC may be generic or i386.
# generic32, generic64, i386, i486, i586, i686
# pentium4, prescott, core, core2, athlon, k6, k8, amdfam10, etc.
# + mmx, sse, sse2, sse3, sse4, 3dnow
# Examples:
# ARCH=-march=i386
# ARCH=-march=i486+sse2
# ARCH=-march=i586
# ARCH=-march=i686 -mtune=athlon -msse -mno-sse4 -m64
# For PowerPC: 401, 403, 630, 740, 7400, 7450, 8540, power7, etc.
# GCC info only uses -mcpu for powerpc, dont know if -march will work.
# ARCH=-mcpu=630 -m64
# ARCH=-mcpu=G5 -maltivec -mabi=altivec
# Let the compiler detect your hardware.
# ARCH=-march=native
# Plain cpu selection will default to -march.
# ARCH=i686
ARCH=-march=i686

# For PowerPC: 401, 403, 630, 740, 7400, 7450, 8540, power7, G5, etc.
# GCC info only uses -mcpu for powerpc, dont know if -march will work.

# The dlopen lib is needed for dynamic loading of device libraries (HAVE_xx=3).
# The dlopen lib is standard, unless you are making a really minimal Linux.
# Not having this set means dynamic loading will be disabled,

# Have dlopen lib.

# The option ZIPWAD (in doomdef.h) needs libzip.

# Optional, load with dlopen.
