<p>
Make sure you read this, you will discover a lot of goodies available
in Legacy! Be a Doom power user!<br/>
Skip to <a href="#reference">section 2</a> and browse through the list of commands if you're
in a hurry!
</p>


<h2 id="basics">Console basics</h2>

<h3 id="usage">Console usage</h3>

<p>With the DoomLegacy console, you will be able to change most of the game
parameters from within the game, and customize it to your preferences.
The console is simply a command prompt, where you can enter commands
and change the values of game variables.
The first game console we know of was from id Software's game Quake.
We have been inspired by it and have tried to implement the same
functionality for the benefit of Quake/Doom fans.
</p>

<p>To open the console, press the <b>console key</b>.
The default console key is the accent key located just below ESC.
You can change your console key using the Setup Controls menu, or edit it in
the config.cfg file.
To exit the console, either press the console key again, or press
<b>ESC</b> which will close the console, and bring up the menu.
</p>

<p>The console displays all messages from the game. You can go back in
the messages with key <b>PAGE UP</b>, and go down with the key <b>PAGE
DOWN</b>. Press the key <b>HOME</b> to jump to the oldest message in the
console text buffer,
and key <b>END</b> to jump to the last output message (the most recent).
</p>

<p>When the console is off, the last lines of the console text buffer are
displayed at the top of the screen.
There you can see 5 lines of messages (the original Doom only showed 1 line).
You can change the message display duration with the console variable
<a href="#con_hudtime">con_hudtime</a>.
See the commands section for more information.
</p>


<h3 id="input">Console input</h3>

<p>While the console is on, you can type in commands.
<b>BACKSPACE</b> erases the last input character, and <b>ENTER</b> executes the command.
For convenience, you have a history of the last 32 commands entered.
Press <b>UP ARROW</b> to go back in the commands history, <b>DOWN ARROW</b> to
go forward.
</p>

<p>
Another useful key is <b>TAB</b>: it completes a partially
entered command or variable name.
This is also a good way to sequence through the existing commands,
without having to remember their exact spelling.
Enter the first letter, then press <b>TAB</b> to complete the command.
Each press of <b>TAB</b> displays another alternative command.
</p>

<p>Use <b>SHIFT-TAB</b> to step through the alternatives in reverse order.
It also completes the command line, when used after typing.
</p>

<div class="example">
The variables to customize the console itself usually start
with "con_". To see them all type "con" and press the <b>TAB</b> key.
The first con_ variable will be displayed, con_height.  Each press of
the <b>TAB</b> key will display the next variable, 
con_speed, con_hudtime, con_backpic...
</div>



<h3 id="cmd_var">Commands and variables</h3>

<p>The console accepts commands, and the setting and display of variables.
A <b>command</b> executes an operation.  It may have parameters.
A <b>variable</b> always has an associated value.
For example the variable <span class="keyword">name</span> holds your name as a player.
</p>

<p>Entering a command without any parameters will usually display the command syntax.
</p>

<div class="code">> map
Usage: map &lt;number|name&gt; [&lt;entrypoint&gt;]: warp players to a map.
</div>

<p>Entering a variable name without a value will display the current
value of the variable.
</p>

<div class="code">> name
"name" is "flynn"
</div>

<p>
To set the value of a variable, enter the variable name followed by the new value.
For example, to change your name to "dj fab", type
</p>

<div class="code">> name "dj fab"
flynn renamed to dj fab
</div>

<p>
There are several types of variable and command parameters.
The legal values differ according to the variable type.
</p>
<p><b>String</b>:<br>
String values can be simple, such as Fred, or quoted, such as "Mr. Fred",
String values that contain spaces, or certain other special characters,
must be <b>quoted</b> using double quotes, as we saw in the previous example.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="code">> name "Punkin Smasher"
</div>
<p>
Inside a quoted string you can use the following C-style <b>backslash escape sequences</b>:
</p>
<table class="def">
  <tr><th>Escape sequence</th><th>Resulting character</th></tr>
  <tr><td>\\</td><td>literal backslash</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\"</td><td>double quote (does not end the string!)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\t</td><td>tab</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\n</td><td>newline</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="code">> echo "this string contains \"escaped\" special chars such as \\,\n\ttab and newline"
this string contains "escaped" special chars such as \,
    tab and newline
</div>

<p><b>Boolean</b>:<br>
Boolean variables (true/false, yes/no) use 0 to denote false.
Any nonzero value means true.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="code">> allowjump 0
</div>

<p><b>Integer</b>:<br>
Integer variables are simple integer values, such as 2, and 13.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="code">> con_height 48
</div>

<p><b>Enum</b>:<br>
Enum variables are integer variables with a limited set of values.
They can be set by the name of the enum value, or by the integer value.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="code">> showmessages verbose
</div>

<p><b>Float</b>:<br>
The float values are decimal values with a decimal point, such as 13.2, and 0.5.
Float values are stored as 16.16 fixed point numbers.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="code">> gravity  1.25
</div>


<h3 id="config">Configuration files</h3>

<p>Many variables are automatically saved to the default configuration
file <b>config.cfg</b>, in the home directory.
Like in the original Doom, the <a href="legacy.html#config">-config</a>
command-line parameter will specify the configuration file.
Thus, you can have default settings for different persons, using
different configuration files.
While the configuration files support any commands, and are executed
like a script, you should not edit them, because they are always overwritten
with the current settings when the game exits.
</p>

<p>Some variables, like gravity, are not saved.  They are restored to
initial settings every time DoomLegacy is started.  These might be
changed for a specific game, but would not want to be saved, as that
would affect all games that follow.  See Autoexec.cfg and exec files for
setting up DoomLegacy for a specific game.
</p>

<p>Each video drawmode has a drawmode config file that is loaded
after the main config.cfg file is loaded.
It can save the values of control variables that depend upon the drawmode.
When the video drawmode is set, the appropriate drawmode config file is loaded.
</p>
<p>
When a value is loaded from the drawmode config file, it will push
down and hide the value loaded from the main config file.
All other control variables will still have the value from the main config file, or a default value.
When menu options are changed, those changes will be saved to the
config file that last loaded that control variable.
</p>

<p>Each drawmode can have separate settings for video mode, fullscreen,
gamma, and can save any other control variable that is saved in config.
Thus, the OpenGL drawmode can have a different Gamma setting, than the
Software drawmodes.  All the other control variables will continue to
have the value loaded from the main config file.
</p>
<p>By default, the drawmode config are empty.  The files will not be
written unless they contain some control variable to be saved.
The user must set this up by the INSERT of a control variable while using
the drawmode.
</p>

<p>The menu interface can edit which control variables are saved in each config
file.  Entries can be inserted and deleted.</p>
<table class="def">
<tr><td>F1</td><td>normal menu view</td></tr>
<tr><td>F2</td><td>Main config values only</td></tr>
<tr><td>F3</td><td>Drawmode config values only</td></tr>
<tr><td>F4</td><td>normal menu</td></tr>
<tr><td>INSERT</td><td>add the menu item to the config file</td></tr>
<tr><td>DEL</td><td>delete the menu item from the config file</td></tr>
</table>

Example: Add Gamma settings to the native drawmode.  Note that Gamma
settings are unusual in that there is a Gamma function, and separate
Gamma, Black, and Bright.
<ul>
<li>Change to the Native drawmode.</li>
<li>Go to the Video Options menu.</li>
<li>Move to the gamma function option.</li>
<li>Press F3, to edit the drawmode config file.</li>
<li>Press INSERT to add gamma function to the drawmode config file.</li>
<li>Change the gamma function as desired.</li>
<li>Move to the gamma value.</li>
<li>Press INSERT to add the gamma value to the drawmode config file.</li>
<li>Repeat for any other values that are used by the gamma function.</li>
<li>Press F1, to return to the normal options menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes to the gamma value, while in Native drawmode, will now only change
the Native drawmode config value.  The main config file value is
pushed down and hidden when a value from a drawmode config file is
present.  When the program is exited and the config is saved, the
gamma value will be saved back to the Native drawmode config file.
The gamma value in the main config file will not be affected.
</p>

<p>Other drawmodes, that do not have a gamma setting of their own,
will use the main config file gamma settings.</p>

<p>Menu entries that are not relevant to the drawmode config, like the control
key assignments, do not have support for insert to the drawmode config
file.</p>

<p>The command line can be used to load a personal main config file,
which may contain personal key assignments.  This does not affect the
loading of drawmode config files.  If there are gamma settings in a
drawmode config file, they will overload any settings from whatever main
config file that is loaded.
To get better personal control, the user will have to specify a different home directory.
</p>

<p>The config files can always be edited using an ordinary editor
to include anything. It may be easier to initially create drawmode
config files with a text editor, and copy a few lines from your existing config file.
Mistakes and comments will be ignored and lost.
When the program is exited, the file will be
overwritten with the most recent saved values.</p>

<table class="def">
<tr><td>Software 8 bit </td><td>config8p.cfg</td></tr>
<tr><td>Software 15 bit</td><td>config15.cfg</td></tr>
<tr><td>Software 16 bit</td><td>config16.cfg</td></tr>
<tr><td>Software 24 bit</td><td>config24.cfg</td></tr>
<tr><td>Software 32 bit</td><td>config32.cfg</td></tr>
<tr><td>Native</td><td>confign.cfg</td></tr>
<tr><td>OpenGL</td><td>configgl.cfg</td></tr>
<tr><td>MiniGL</td><td>configmg.cfg</td></tr>
<tr><td>Glide</td><td>configwg.cfg</td></tr>
<tr><td>D3D</td><td>configwd.cfg</td></tr>
</table>



<h3 id="autoexec">Autoexec.cfg</h3>

<p>The <b>autoexec.cfg</b> file is a text 'script' file which, if
found, is automatically executed at the game startup.
You can edit autoexec.cfg to set the values of those variables
that are not automatically saved to config.cfg. You can also add
commands that will be executed one after another, just like a script.
</p>

<p>Comments start with <b>//</b>.
Each line of the autoexec.cfg file is like a line that you would have
typed at the console. Here are some examples:
</p>

<p>This sample 'autoexec.cfg' will warp you to map01 as soon as the
game is loaded:
</p>

<div class="example">
// always start with map01, without waiting at the menu<br/>
map map01<br/>
echo "welcome to map 01"   //useless comment
</div>

<p>Another example, here we set the variables that are not saved to the
config.cfg, because they are not considered standard parameters:
</p>

<div class="example">
// set my preferred weird game mode<br/>
bloodtime 5   // blood lasts 5 seconds<br/>
fastmonsters 1<br/>
teamdamage 1<br/>
echo "bigjim's weird mode active"
</div>

<p>In the last example, each time you start the game, it will set the
variables like <a href="#bloodtime">bloodtime</a> that are not
normally saved to config.cfg.
Just look at config.cfg to find out which variables are saved.
</p>

<p>Doom Legacy first looks for a user autoexec.cfg file in the home
directory, where the config and savegame files are kept.  This is
intended for the user to own and edit.</p>
<p>If the user autoexec file is not present, it will look for the
autoexec.cfg file with the executable.
This is intended for the installer of the executable to own and edit.
This could be system games, or some other protected directory.</p>
<p>The user autoexec.cfg file can chain to another file, like the
system autoexec.cfg file.</p>
<div class="example">
// Get system settings first<br/>
exec autoexec.cfg<br/>
</div>


<h3 id="scripts">Script files</h3>

<p>config.cfg and autoexec.cfg are script files. It means they
contain commands and variables that are executed in sequence.
You can create any number of script files, and execute them from the console
using the <a href="#exec">exec</a> command.
</p>

<p>For example, to start a script named blood.cfg just enter</p>

<div class="example">
&gt; exec blood.cfg
</div>



<hr/>
<h2 id="reference">Console commands and variables</h2>

<p>This chapter describes all the console commands and variables in Doom
Legacy.
Many console variables can also be modified through the menu.
You will need to use the console only if you want to customise the
game more to your needs.
</p>


<h3 id="basic_cmd">Basic commands</h3>

<p>Here are the basic commands for script execution. They have the same
usage and functionality as in Quake.
You can use a <b>semicolon</b> to separate several commands in the same line.
</p>

<table class="def">
<tr><th>command</th><th>definition</th></tr>

<tr><td>alias &lt;aliasname&gt; &lt;command&gt;</td>
<td>
<p>
Define an alias.
When you type &lt;aliasname&gt;, it will be like if you had
entered &lt;command&gt;. Let's have an example:
</p>
<div class="example">
&gt; alias silence "soundvolume 0; musicvolume 0"
</div>
<p>
When you will type "silence", it will execute the
corresponding command. In this example, we have given two
commands as one, inside " ", and using the semicolon as a separator
for commands.
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>echo &lt;text&gt;</td>
<td>Just echoes (prints) the text to console.</td></tr>

<tr><td id="exec">exec &lt;filename&gt;</td>
<td>
<p>
Execute a script file. A script file is just a text file
containing a sequence of commands or variables. Script files
usually have the .cfg extension.
Example:
</p>
<div class="example">
&gt; exec autoexec.cfg
</div>
<p>
will execute all the commands in autoexec.cfg
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>help [&lt;category&gt;|&lt;variable&gt;]</td>
<td>
Shows a list of all the console commands and variables.<br/>
Alone, it will respond with help categories.<br/>
Help of a category
(INFO, CHEAT, COMMAND, SAVEGAME, CONFIG, CONTROL, FS, CHAT, NET, CONSOLE),
will list associated commands.<br/>
Help of a category (VAR, NETVAR, CFGVAR) will list variables of that
category.<br/>
If given a variable name, shows detailed info on that variable.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>toggle &lt;variable&gt; [&lt;value&gt;]</td>
<td>
<p>
Without the &lt;value&gt; parameter this toggles a variable,
i.e. changes it to the next possible value.
With the &lt;value&gt; parameter it adds &lt;value&gt; to the variable.
This command is very useful for use with <a href="#bind">bind</a>. Example:
</p>
<div class="example">
bind "&gt;" "toggle gr_fogdensity"<br/>
bind "&lt;" "toggle gr_fogdensity -1"
</div>
<p>
so you can modify fogdensity without going into the console or menu!
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>wait [&lt;ticks&gt;]</td>
<td>
<p>
Wait a given amount of time before the next command is executed.
The unit is 1/35 seconds. Example: this will wait 5 seconds, then
display "ok!".
</p>
<div class="example">
wait 175; echo "ok!"
</div>
</td></tr>

<tr><td id="bind">bind &lt;keyname&gt; &lt;command&gt;</td>
<td>
<p>
Bind commands to a key. Each time you press the key,
the commands will be executed. Example:
</p>
<div class="example">
&gt; bind s screenshot
</div>
<p>
Now each time you press the s key the game will save a screenshot.
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>cls</td>
<td>Clear the console text buffer.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3 id="game_cmds">Game commands</h3>

<p>

<tr><td>originalweaponswitch</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Choose whether to use the original weapon change method (1), or

<a href="#weaponpref">weaponpref</a> for more.<br/>

With the original weapon switch, whenever you pick up a new weapon
it becomes the active one, even if it is not as powerful
as the one you are currently using. That can be sometimes very
annoying, especially in fast deathmatches.
</td></tr>


<tr><td id="weaponpref">weaponpref</td><td>string</td>
<td>
The preferred weapons order for Player 1.<br/>
This works only if you have set originalweaponswitch to 0.

<p>You give a priority to each of the weapons, with a number digit
from 0 to 9. Several weapons can have the same priority.
When you pick up a weapon that you don't already have, you
will switch to that weapon IF AND ONLY IF that weapon's priority
is greater that the one you are carrying. If you already had the
weapon, you will pickup the ammo as usual, without changing
weapon.
The command is given a string of priority values, one for each weapon, in the following order:
</p>

<p>Fist, Chainsaw, Pistol, Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Chaingun, Rocket
  Launcher, Plasma Rifle, BFG.
</p>

<p>Thus 'weaponpref "021485763"' means that the super shotgun has
the highest priority (8), while the fist is lowest priority (0).
After the super shotgun, in decreasing priority you have the
rocket launcher (7), plasma gun (6), chaingun (5), shotgun (4),
BFG (3), chainsaw (2) and pistol (1).
</p>

<p>Let's have another interesting example: 'weaponpref "333333333"'
</p>

<p>Since all weapons have the same priority in this last example,
you will NEVER change weapon automatically, because
no weapon has a priority higher than any other one. You might
consider this the manual weapon change.

On a level map with a huge number of monsters, find a value where your graphics bog down, and then reduce it until play is tolerable.

  info: Prints useful info about the CD like how many tracks it has.
  <br/>
  remap: Remap the CD track played for each level map.
</p>
</td></tr>

<p>
  Loading the CDROM is slow.  You need to wait until the CDROM is done
  loading the CDROM before you can even get info on it.  If you have
  multiple CDROM, DoomLegacy will try to use the first.  Under Linux
  this is /dev/cdrom.
<p>
  SDL cannot control the CDROM music volume.  Under SDL the CDROM music
  volume control has been reduced to an on/off switch, which does PAUSE.
  SDL 1.2.15 is the end of CDROM support in SDL.  SDL 2.x will not
  support CDROM music.
<p>
  Playing the CDROM music with loop (repeat the song) requires DoomLegacy
  to check that the music has stopped.  With Linux, and probably some other
  systems too, this CDROM hardware check blocks execution for about 1/4 second.
  With previous DoomLegacy versions, this check occurred every 2 seconds.
  DoomLegacy 1.46.3 checks every 4 seconds, near the expected end of
  the music, and only when it is set to loop the music.
<p>
  This CDROM check can be avoided entirely by not using using cd play loop.
  Using CDROM music play loop in a netgame may get you kicked due to
  consistency failure, due to the CDROM check blocking play.
  When loading a new level map, if cd is enabled it will start play loop
  of the track for that map.  Playing a CD using a separate program
  on your computer may work better, especially during net play.
<p>
  Normally, the game plays track xx during map MAPxx.
  With Doom ExMy levels, the track number is 9*x+y.
  The remap command is useful to choose which cd music is played for each
  level map.  All the level maps must be listed sequentially in the remap
  command, it always starts from map01.
  Let's have an example:<br/>
  <br/>
  cd remap 5 3 1 4 2<br/>
  <br/>
  At map 1, the game will play track 5 etc. The same track number can
  be also be repeated.
